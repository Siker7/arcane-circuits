# Arcane Circuits

A logic system designed for Hytale, built to complement a physics-based automation system (like Create or Hynergy) by handling signals, gates, and logic state.
This project started as a standalone mod concept and has shifted toward being a technical showcase and design proposal for how logic should work in a sandbox game like Hytale.

### Arcane Circuits is built on three core design principles:

- No Bluetooth Power: Circuits must always make visual sense. If every other block in the world turns invisible, the circuit should still be complete.
- Emergent Complexity Only: Arcane Circuits components must only be as complex as they need to be so players don't have to invent basic logic from scratch.
- Don't Break Immersion: This system must not break the expectations the game has set for immersion. No jargon, minimal UI, and a fantasy-appropriate aesthetic.

### Project Status:
Now that the design document is complete, the plan is to build this system as a Hytale mod to show off its strengths.

As of February 8, 2026, Implementation has not started yet.

#### - AI Disclosure -
All documentation was written by hand. AI tools assisted with rubber-ducking design decisions, searching Hytale documentation, and answering questions about how Java handles certain design patterns.
